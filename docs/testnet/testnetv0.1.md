# Minimal (off TF grid) test setup

### Step 1: Get yourself a private overlay network

Zerotier is a technologie that provides overlay networking capabilities. In the current version of the TF Grid we use Zerotier networking technology to connect nodes on a grid and provide the necessary connectivity.  The next version of Zero-OS will use ipv6 natively to provide node connectivity.

### Step 2: Setup a private zerotier network.

Getting an overlay network is essential - all coonectivity requirements are currently delivered by zerotier technologie 
- Go to: https://my.zerotier.com/login
- Create an account
- Log into account
- Create a specific - test setup network: https://my.zerotier.com/network

![](/images/testnetv0.1/zerotier-creata-network.png)

Download the zerotier network client one or more controlling PC’s.  Choose the right version for the OS: https://www.zerotier.com/download/

![](/images/testnetv0.1/download_client.png)

Further instructions how to create, install and get the private overlay network installed can be found on on the zerotier web site.

Now we should be able to ping all devices connected to the zerotier networks regardless of where these devices are located.  It is an overlay network working behind NAT and FW’ed connections.

### Step 3: Get the Zero-OS bootloader

Take the zerotier network ID and go to:  http://bootstrap.grid.tf

Choose the master branch of the Zero-OS and input the zerotier network ID

![](/images/testnetv0.1/step1-2.png)

Enable the development flag:  This disables a lot of the security features on the Zero-OS and allows you to connect to the Zero-OS without being authenticated.

![](/images/testnetv0.1/step3.png)

Choose which bootloader method you want to use and download the correct image/script that belongs to that method 

![](/images/testnetv0.1/select-bootloader.png)

Depending on the use case (virtual / physical) make a physical boot device of use the selected method for the Virtualisation technology.
In this case - configure Virtualbox to boot the iso image 
After a while of will be booted completely (depending on your network speed)

![](/images/testnetv0.1/zero-os-booting.png)

And you can see the zerotier address of your private (zerotier) network, and the assumed private IP addresses. In your zerotier management portal there is a section with private overlay members.  Your booted Zero-OS should show up as a new member and you need to authorize it to become part of the secured overlay network.

At this point in time you should have succeeded to get the following items done.  These need to be finished otherwise you will not be able to connect to your private, off-grid, unsecured Zero-OS machine.

1. Create a zerotier account and overlay network
2. Download, install and configure the zerotier client for your laptop to connect with
3. Configure and Download the Zero-OS bootloader in the preferred format for you specific setup:  USB, ISO, PXE script.
4. Accept the booted Zero-OS node in your private overlay network.  This network should now have two nodes as a minumum:  You laptop and your Zero-OS machine.

###  Step 4: Download and install the Zero-OS container manager

The Zero-OS container manager has been designed and created to hide a lot of conplexity for simple testing of the effectiveness of the operating system and containers running on it.  It provides a simple interface for experimenting with a private setup.  The software is opensource and can be found here: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos

The specific instructions to build the zos client on your operating systems are [here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos/blob/development/doc/building.md).  You have succesfully installed the zos client you should be able to run it (depending on where you have put the binary) as follows:

![](/images/testnetv0.1/zos_commandline.png)

### Step 5: Launch and stop containers.

Here we assume that the ip address of the booted Zero-OS machine is `10.244.199.142`.  We add the machine to the zos confguration file:

```
zos configure --name="github-demo" --address=10.244.199.142
zos setdefault github-demo
```

After doing this the zos client is set to use the "github-demo" machine as a default target and this can be tested by doing the following test-ping: `

```
zos ping
"PONG Version: master @Revision: b1a1a737352fce69fd71de5f8cf1ae175f4bdcab"
```

The zos container management app has a rich set of commands to launch, configure and stop containers.

```

  zos init --name=<zosmachine> [--disksize=<disksize>] [--memory=<memorysize>] [--redisport=<redisport>] [--reset]

  zos container <id> download <file> <dest>
  zos container upload <file> <dest>
  zos container download <file> <dest>
  zos help <cmdname>
  zos --version
```

To list the running containers on the Zero-OS you enter the following command:

```
zos container list
+----+-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| ID | Name      | Ports         | Root                                                          |
+----+-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | zrobot    | zt*:6600:6600 | tf-official-apps/threefoldtech-0-robot-autostart-latest.flist |
+----+-----------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

To launch a new container you can get the required flist (file list, software can be found [here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-flist)) from the central hub on which these flists are collected and made avaiable to TESTNET users.  The principle of an flist is that the binaries needed to run the containerised applications are stored in a central hub (which can be many - the TESTNET one is one we installed bu you can create your own based on the software presented [here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/0-hub).

![](/images/testnetv0.1/hub-splash.png)

Let's take an example flist to showcase the simple structure of commands to launch a container: mongoDB

![](/images/testnetv0.1/mongo-flist.png)

In order to launch the container we need to URL that point to the flist and parse it to the process manager on the Zero-OS.  The URL pointer to the flist is:
```
https://hub.grid.tf/weynand/mongo-latest.flist
```

Launching a container is done as follows:

```
Weynands-MacBook-Pro:~ weynandkuijpers$ zos container new --name="mongodb" --root=https://hub.grid.tf/weynand/mongo-latest.flist
INFO preparing container
INFO sending instructions to host
INFO container 3 is created.
INFO creating portforward from 1024 to 22
INFO waiting for private network connectivity
container private address: 10.244.199.142
Weynands-MacBook-Pro:~ weynandkuijpers$ zos container list
+----+---------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| ID | Name    | Ports         | Root                                                          |
+----+---------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | zrobot  | zt*:6600:6600 | tf-official-apps/threefoldtech-0-robot-autostart-latest.flist |
| 3  | mongodb | 1024:22       | weynand/mongo-latest.flist                                    |
+----+---------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
```

So we have a mongoDB running.  In order to inspect it the zos client has a built in feature to start an openssh daemon to provider remote access.  This will not be available in the production version of the Zero-OS but come in very handy for testnet.

```

        "via": null
      }
    ],
    "status": "OK",
    "type": "PUBLIC"
  }
]
```

From this `zerotierlist` command we can deduct which private IPv4 address is associated with the mongoDB container and have enabled the openssh deamon allowing us to access the container through ssh:
```
