# Available Testnet setups

To familiarize groups of people witht the TF Tech technology there are a number of testnets available.  These setups allow for private and public service deployments.

## Testnet V0.1
The first availabel testnet setup is a testnet setups where we bring down all of the security fences that exist in the Zero-OS operating system.  In this setup people can directly start, stop and destroy containers on a physical (or virtual) Zero-OS machine.

## Testnet V0.5
The current TF grid (https://radar.threefold.io/) is operating in TESTNET mode.  This means that the end-to-end market of providing capacity (real token farming) and renting (TESTNET token spending) is operational.  This provides a comprehensive insight into what the workings of this grid will be when launched live.
