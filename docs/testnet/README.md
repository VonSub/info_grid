# Available Testnet setups

To familiarize groups of people with the TF Tech technology there are several testnets available. These setups allow for private and public service deployments.

## Testnet V0.1
The first available Testnet setup is one where we bring down all of the security fences that exist in the Zero-OS operating system. In this setup, people can directly start, stop and destroy containers on a physical (or virtual) Zero-OS machine.

## Testnet V2.0 

### Coming Soon!
