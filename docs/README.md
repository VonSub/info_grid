# ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid)

![](/images/world.png)

The ThreeFold Grid is built by a collective of independent people that together create a pool of Internet compute and storage capacity that fuels a cryptocurrency token economy resulting in a very stable currency (the TF Token) that is used to buy and sell this capacity and many other items in the near future.

This WIKI presents the basic information required to participate in the ThreeFold Grid in some different roles.  Examples roles are:
- **a farmer**:  these are the people that put forward investments to build and operate the internet capacity pool.  Farmers purchase and operate compute and storage hardware that they list on the TF Grid.
- **a cooperative**: this is an organization that performs most of the logistical and operational tasks for the actual farming activity. Its function is to help farmers that are looking for an investment-only model to participate.
- **a developer**: these are people that build services and applications that run on the TF Grid.
- **a customer**:  customers use applications on the TF Grid and consume TF Grid resources for which they pay in TF tokens.
