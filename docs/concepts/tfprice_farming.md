Trade 1:	10,000 TFT 	at 	USD 0.25 traded (sell and buy match)

Trade 2:	1,000 TFT 	at 	USD 0.12

Trade 3: 	500 TFT 	at 	USD 0.15

Trade 4: 	2,000 TFT 	at 	USD 0.16

Trade 5: 	300 TFT 	at 	USD 0.15

Trade 6: 	3,000 TFT 	at 	USD 0.17

Trade 7: 	9,000 TFT	at 	USD 0.20

Trade 8: 	1,000 TFT 	at 	USD 0.15

Trade 9: 	500 TFT 	at 	USD 0.16

Trade 10: 	1,000 TFT 	at 	USD 0.18

The trades 3 - 10 will be used for the calculation. These 8 trades reflect a trading volume of 17,300 TFT in total.
