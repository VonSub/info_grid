##  How can it be prevented that 3bots are given malicious code and deploy criminal activities on threefold network?

Very interesting question.  As show in the figure 3bots receive their knowledge (abilities) from IT experts.  These IT experts will be for a very large part developers or system integrators that have good intentions and want to build or launch a new services.  But, there will be people that will abuse the 3bot technology to launch malicious and or fraudulous appplications.  What can be done about that?  

The system in itself allows for anyone to build and create services on top of the TF Grid  and by the decentralised nature the ThreeFold foundation or TF Tech will not govern, This would be 100% against the decentralised nature of this project.

The answer is not found in the technology, Although the technology has features which help with this, let's first dive into the non-technical answer to the question. Tthe answers to this question is simnple and follows the rules of every day life. In real life we all conduct check and balances for everything we do and everybody we engage with.  Some examples:
- Does the shopfront look legit?  
- Is the car sales man some on I can trust, let's ask my friend that bought a car from him half a year ago. 
- Is there some talk on the internet about this e-commerce site, do they really ship order or take the monney and run
- Doe this e-commerce site have the blessing of the consumers protection association?

We do do check and balances in real life which gives us insight into what is a ligitimate business to deal with and what not.  In the ever increasing complex world we live in this is becoming more and more important, we cannot rely anymore on being protected by central organisations like goverments, police, banks etc.

For 3bot this works in the same way. 3bots are being given capabilities and knowledge by IT experts.  These IT experts can seek digital verifications with known internet verifiers.  I well used machnism for central organisations to understand who they accept as customers is Know Your Customer [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer).  This same mechanism can be used on the 3bot world for IT export, knowledge providers, to be verified for customers.  So it is reputation based where the 3bot will have a reputation based on it's past, based on it's bahavious an based on all the interactions with other 3bots.  All this information is stored in decentralised databases (called blockchain databases, BCDB, innovation by TF Technology) which have the characteristics of blockchain:
- always append data  
- immutable data

So the reputation is stored and available for all to inspect.

The technical answer to this question is that the technology has a built in consensus mechanism (item 4 in the image) where end users, consumers of services, can launch a service if it consensus is reached amongst a group of endusers (which can be people or legal entities represented on this grid by respective 3bots).  Respected people people or legal entities will offer verifications services which IT experts can build into their services.  This is a build in consensus mechanism.
