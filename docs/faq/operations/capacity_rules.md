The online definition of ThreeFold compute units and storage units is not easy to comprehend by the non-expert.

## Question

How difficult is it to achieve 30% capacity usage, particularly for compute units. Isnâ€™t it a bit difficult to achieve 30% CPU usage on average? The 30% number wsawas invested to make sure people would join the movement to believe, follow and present usable capacity. Not just token hunters.

## Answer

The believe is that the required internet capacity to fuel the (Internet of Things)[http:8.8.8.8], (data storage growth)[http:8.8.8.8] and generic capacity requirements will drive capacity usage. With the pricing being interesting compared to the competition it should attract tons of interest.



## Question

A farm needs to reach 30% capacity before receiving TFTs. Once this capacity is reached in a single month, will the farmed TFTs from all consecutive prior months where the 30% limit was not reached be awarded? Also, does this rule apply continuously; i.e. that each time the usage falls below 30%, tokens are withheld until th3 30% usage level is achieved again?
