# This document shows how to setup/migrate your ThreeFold Farm and 3Nodes to TF Grid 2.0 (JSX Version)
NOTE: This guide is for experts only. If you need assistance please send an email to support@threefold.tech

## Prerequiste: Install jumpscale container

See https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core/blob/development/docs/Installation/README.md to know how to install jumpscale container

## 1. Register your identity on the TF Grid

As indicated in the install description start the kosmos shell inside your jsx container.  Then follow these instructions to get yourself a 3bot and attach your farm to it.

Connect to the right environment (testnet in example)
```python
j.clients.threebot.explorer_addr_set('explorer.testnet.grid.tf') 
```

Register your identity. To do so use `j.tools.threebot.init_my_threebot` function.
It takes 3 arguments

- name: This is your name on the grid. It must ends with .3bot'
- email: Email address link to this identity. Make sure to use a valid email address
- description: optional field. You can specify anything.

```python
j.tools.threebot.init_my_threebot(
    name='myname.3bot',
    email='myname@gmail.com',
    description="anything can go here")
```
## 2. Create a TF Farm

Now that your identity is known on the grid, you can create a farm.
To do so, you need to connect to the grid explorer 3bot.

```python
# set the address of the explorer
j.clients.threebot.explorer_addr_set('explorer.testnet.grid.tf')
# get a client to the explorer
explorer = j.clients.threebot.explorer
# get schema from server to client
explorer.actors_all
# create your farm
farm = j.data.schema.get_from_url('tfgrid.directory.farm.1').new()
farm.name = 'my_super_farm'
farm.threebot_id = j.tools.threebot.me.default.tid
# Instruction below is only for farms which already exist in version 1.x and need to be migrated to version 2.0 !
# Specify the ItsYouOnline organization link to the farm
farm.iyo_organization = 'my_super_farm_v1'
# the tfchain wallet where the farming token neeeds to be paid. If this field is empty you won't be able to
# receive the farming token
farm.wallet_addresses = ['.....']
# email address where farming result and any information for farmer will be sent.
farm.email = 'myname@gmail.com'
# actually register the farm on the grid
explorer.actors_all.farms.register(farm)
```

If the last function succeeded, your farm is now created.
If you go to the explorer web UI you should be able to see your farm in "All farms" dropdown list.

## 3. Create a bootable image

Use this bootsstrap service: https://bootstrap.grid.tf, with farmer ID = the farm_id generated in step 2.  

## 4. Start 3Node with bootable image

After booting your 3Node it is visible on: (add mainnet explorer)
